# rusty-com-port
Safe(ish) Rust wrapper for Windows COM interfaces (D3D12, DWrite, DXGI...)

Somewhat stable modules are d3d12_safe, d3d12sdklayers_safe, dxgi_safe, dxgi1_2_safe, dxgi1_3_safe, dxgi1_4_safe.

Other modules are empty or didn't cover all functionality.

Wrappers were generated by [dxgen](https://github.com/red75prime/dxgen)
